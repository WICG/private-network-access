  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Although [[RFC1918]] has specified a distinction between "private" and
  "public" internet addresses for over a decade, user agents haven't made
  much progress at segregating the one from the other. Websites on the public
  internet can make requests to internal devices and servers, which enable a
  number of malicious behaviors, including attacks on users' routers like those
  documented in [[DRIVE-BY-PHARMING]] (and, more recenly, [[CSRF-EXPLOIT-KIT]]).

  Here, we propose a mitigation against these kinds of attacks that would
  require internal devices to explicitly opt-in to requests from the public
  internet.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <h4 id="example-deny-by-default">Secure by Default</h4>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc's routers don't have any interest in requests from the public
    internet, and wish to deny them by default. This is trivial, and doesn't
    require any effort on their part.

    When a website on the public internet makes a request to the router, the
    user agent determines that the requestor is <a>public</a>, and the router
    is <a>private</a>. The UA deems the router private because the public web
    application addresses it with a private IP address (see below), or
    because the UA resolves the router's name to a private IP address. This
    means that requests will trigger a <a>CORS-preflight request</a> as
    follows:

    <pre>
      OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
      Host: 192.168.1.1
      <a>Access-Control-Request-Method</a>: GET
      ...
      Origin: https://public.example.com
    </pre>

    The router can either respond with an error status code, or can refuse to
    include <a>`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`</a>,
    <a>`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`</a>,
    <a>`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`</a>, and
    <a>`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`</a>
    headers in its response. As long as those headers are not present, the
    response will fail a <a>CORS check</a>, and the request will be blocked.
  </div>

  <h4 id="example-opt-in">Opting-In</h4>

  <div class="example">
    Some of MegaCorp Inc's devices actually need to talk to the public internet
    for various reasons. They can explicitly opt-in to receiving requests from
    the internet by sending proper CORS headers in response to a
    <a>CORS-preflight request</a>.

    When a website on the public internet makes a request to the device, the
    user agent determines that the requestor is <a>public</a>, and the router
    is <a>private</a>. This means that requests will trigger a <a>CORS-preflight
    request</a>, just as above.

    The device can explicitly grant access by sending the right headers in its
    response. For the above request, that might look like:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: https://public.example.com
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</a>: GET
      <a>Access-Control-Max-Age</a>: 86400
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</a>: true
      Vary: Origin
      Content-Length: 0
      ...
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h2 id="framework">Framework</h2>

  An IPv4 address is a <dfn export local-lt="private">private address</dfn> if
  it matches the <a>private address space</a> defined in Section 3 of
  [[!RFC1918]], and a <dfn export local-lt="public">public address</dfn>
  otherwise.

  An IPv6 address is a <a>private address</a> if it matches the "Unique Local
  Address" prefix (`fc00::/7`) defined in Section 3 of [[!RFC4193]] or the
  "link-local" prefix (`fe80::/10`) defined in section 2.5.6 of [[!RFC4291]],
  and a <a>public address</a> otherwise.

<!-- Big Text: Integrations -->
<section>
  <h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This document proposes a number of modifications to other specifications in
  order to implement the mitigations sketched out in the examples above. These
  integrations are outlined here for clarity, but the external documents are the
  normative references.

  <h3 id="integration-fetch">Integration with Fetch</h3>

  This document proposes a few changes to Fetch, with the following
  implications:

  1.  <a>Requests</a> whose <a for="request">client</a>'s <a>public internet
      flag</a> is not set are unchanged from status quo. They may continue to
      make requests to <a>public</a> and <a>private</a> addresses as they do
      today.

  2.  <a>Requests</a> whose <a for="request">client</a>'s <a>public internet
      flag</a> is set are allowed to fetch resources from <a>private
      addresses</a> if and only if the <a for="request">client</a> is a
      <a>secure context</a> <em>and</em> a <a>CORS-preflight request</a> to the
      target origin passes a <a>CORS check</a>.

      Note: UAs must not allow <a lt="secure context">non-secure</a>
      <a>public</a> contexts to request resources from <a>private
      addresses</a>, even if the private server
      would opt-in to such a request via a preflight. Making requests to
      <a>private</a> resources presents risks which are mitigated by ensuring
      the integrity of the <a for="request">client</a> which initiates the
      request. In particular, network attackers should not be able to trivially
      exploit an endpoint's consent to a non-secure origin.

  To that end, the <a>main fetch</a> algorithm should be adjusted as follows:

  1.  Before the current step 9 (which contains a large switch that directs the
      request into the proper fetching algorithm), execute the following steps:

      9.  If |request|'s <a for="request">current url</a>'s {{URL/host}} maps to
          a <a>private address</a>, and |request|'s
          <a for="request">client</a>'s <a>public internet flag</a> is set:

          1.  If |request|'s <a for="request">client</a> is not a <a>secure
              context</a>, return a <a>network error</a>.

          2.  Set |request|'s <a>use-CORS-preflight flag</a>.

          3.  Set |request|'s <a for="request">mode</a> to "`cors`".

  Note: This will require a preflight for <em>every</em> request initiated from
  a <a>public address</a> that targets a <a>private address</a>. This includes
  navigations.

  Further, the <a>CORS check</a> algorithm should be adjusted to ensure that
  consent is explicitly granted to the <a>public</a> origin which requested
  the <a>private</a> preflight:

  1.  After the current step 3 (which verifies that a wildcard
      <a>`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`</a> grant cannot allow credentials),
      execute the following step:

      4.  If |response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s {{URL/host}} maps to
          a <a>private address</a>, and |request|'s
          <a for="request">client</a>'s <a>public internet flag</a> is set,
          and |origin| is "`*`", return failure.

  Finally, to address the possibility of DNS rebinding attacks (see
  [[#dns-rebinding]]), we need to adjust the <a>CORS-preflight cache</a> to
  distinguish between a <a>public</a> and a <a>private</a> origin.

  ISSUE: Spell the cache modifications out a bit more clearly.

  ISSUE: [[FETCH]] does not yet integrate the details of DNS resolution into the
  Fetch algorithm, though it does define an <a>obtain a connection</a>
  algorithm which is a good start. We'll need to think about things like Happy
  Eyeballs [[RFC6555]] to make sure that we perform the right checks depending
  on the IP address we actually connect to. For the moment, this document
  assumes that connection information is available in the <a>main fetch</a>
  algorithm. That might not be a reasonable assumption, in which case we'll
  need to revisit all of this.

  ISSUE(mikewest/cors-rfc1918#1): Chris Palmer suggests that we might want to
  change the proposal such that private services must always opt-in to being
  contacted by anyone other than themselves. That is, we'd drop implication
  #1 above in favor of forcing a preflight for all requests to private servers,
  whether they come from public addresses, or private addresses.

  <h3 id="integration-html">Integration with HTML</h3>

  To support the checks in [[FETCH]], we store a <dfn>public internet flag</dfn>
  on both {{Document}} and {{WorkerGlobalScope}} objects, which is set if the
  {{Document}} or {{Worker}} was initialized via a resource which was delivered
  from a <a>public address</a>, and unset otherwise.

  <div class="example">
    Assuming that `example.com` resolves to a <a>public address</a> (say,
    `123.123.123.123`), then the {{Document}} created when navigating to
    `https://example.com/document.html` will have its <a>public internet
    flag</a> set.

    If, on the other hand, `example.com` resolved to a <a>private address</a>
    (say, `127.0.0.1`), then the {{Document}} created when navigating to
    `https://example.com/document.html` will not have its <a>public internet
    flag</a> set.
  </div>

<section>
  <h2 id="implementation-considerations">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="file-url">`file` URLs</h3>

  It isn't entirely clear how `file` URLs fit into the public/private scheme
  outlined above. It would be nice to prevent folks from harming themselves by
  opening a malicious HTML file locally, on the one hand, but on the other, code
  running locally is somewhat outside of any sane threat model.

  For the moment, let's err on the side of treating `file` URLs as
  <a>private</a>, as they seem to be just as much a part of the local system
  as anything else on a loopback address.

  <h3 id="too-much-access">Too Much Access</h3>

  Note that the proposed scheme requires <a>private</a> resources which can be
  loaded by the <a>public</a> internet to make themselves CORS-same-origin with
  the loading origin. That might lead developers to inadvertently grant too
  much access if they set a blanket policy for all of a devices resources.
  Instead, our hope is that developers will carefully consider whether a
  particular resource actually needs to be exposed to the web before opting it
  in. That is, developers ought to send CORS headers back <em>only</em> in
  response to preflight requests for resources which it explicitly intends to
  make available to the public internet.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="security-and-privacy-considerations">Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="user-mediation">User Mediation</h3>

  The proposal in this document only ensures that the device consents to access
  from the public internet. Users agents SHOULD ensure that the <em>user</em>
  consents to such access as well, as it might be in their interests to deny
  such access, even though the device itself would allow it.

  This mediation could be done via an explicit permission grant, via some sort
  of pairing ceremony a la
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement">PAKE</a>,
  or any other clever interface which the user agent might devise.

  <h3 id="mixed-content">Mixed Content</h3>

  Note that the CORS restrictions added by the proposal in this document do not
  obviate mixed content checks [[!MIXED-CONTENT]]. Developers who wish to
  fetch <a>private</a> resources from <a>public</a> pages MUST ensure that the
  connection is secure. This might involve a solution along the lines of
  [[PLEX]], or we might end up inventing a new way of ensuring a secure
  connection to devices (perhaps the pairing ceremony hinted at above, or one of
  the ideas floated in [[SECURE-LOCAL-COMMUNICATION]]?). In either case,
  consenting to access by sending proper CORS is necessary, but not sufficient.Q

  <h3 id="loopback">Loopback vs Intranet</h3>

  Opera Presto apparently had three levels.
  As opposed to this document's <a>private</a>/<a>public</a> distinction, Opera
  Presto <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=378566#c6">apparently</a>
  had three levels: internet, intranet, and localhost. The same restrictions
  were applied from internet to intranet as from intranet to localhost. That
  might be a reasonable hardening measure to consider after we get the first
  pass done.

  <h3 id="dns-rebinding">DNS Rebinding</h3>

  The mitigation described here operates upon the IP address which the user
  agent actually connects to when loading a particular resource. This check
  MUST be performed for each new connection made, as DNS rebinding attacks
  may otherwise trick the user agent into revealing information it shouldn't.

  The modifications to the <a>CORS-preflight cache</a> are intended to mitigate
  this attack vector.

  <h3 id="scope-access">Scope of Access</h3>

  The proposal in this document does not allow a device to distinguish between
  granting an origin access to load its resources from making that origin
  CORS-same-origin with itself. That matches the intent of a number of use cases
  (e.g. `dropbox.com` communicating with the locally-installed Dropbox app,
  `pebble.com` communicating with a local watch, etc.) but might not match
  others.

  If we decide that building something with a narrower scope is reasonable, then
  something like an `Access-Control-Allow-Public: true` HTTP response header
  might be a reasonable approach.

  <h3 id="scope-mitigation">Scope of Mitigation</h3>

  The proposal in this document merely mitigates attacks against private web
  services, it cannot fully solve them. For example, a router's
  web-based administration interface must be designed and implemented to defend
  against CSRF on its own, and should not rely on a UA that behaves as specified
  in this document. The mitigation this document specifies is necessary given
  the reality of private web service implementation quality today, but vendors
  should not consider themselves absolved of responsibility, even if all UAs
  implement this mitigation.
